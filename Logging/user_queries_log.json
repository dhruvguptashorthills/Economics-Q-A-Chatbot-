        "question": "What is a deflationary spiral?",
        "answer": "A deflationary spiral is a situation where decreasing prices lead to lower production, which in turn lowers wages and demand, causing further price decreases.  This creates a vicious cycle, where a problem exacerbates its own cause.  It's often associated with economic depressions, like the Great Depression.  The decreasing price level negatively impacts the economy through reduced production, wages, and demand.\n"

        "question": "what is gdp",
        "answer": "GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is a measure of the total value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period.  It's a key indicator of a country's economic performance.  Important nuances include that:\n\n* **Different estimations:** Calculating GDP involves complex processes to account for various sectors (public, financial, intangible assets) and changing international conventions.\n* **Real vs. nominal:** Raw GDP data is nominal (current values). Real GDP adjusts for inflation using the GDP deflator.\n* **Per capita GDP:**  GDP can be adjusted for population to show average output per person.\n* **Historical context:**  GDP emerged as a key measurement tool, especially after World War II, and even the way it is calculated has evolved over time.  GNP, a similar measure, was initially preferred.  The switch to GDP reflects a focus on measuring production by residents of the country.\n"

        "question": "What differentiates monopolies from perfect competition?",
        "answer": "In perfect competition, all participants are \"price takers,\" meaning no single participant can influence the price of a product.  In contrast, monopolies are characterized by a single seller, giving them the ability to influence the price of their product.  This difference in market structure is the key distinction.  Monopolies are a form of imperfect competition, where the single seller holds market power, unlike the many competing sellers in a perfectly competitive market.\n"

        "question": "How does fiscal policy influence inflation?",
        "answer": "Fiscal policy, through deficit spending, can increase demand, potentially leading to inflation, especially at low unemployment rates.  Conversely, reducing the deficit or running a surplus can lower demand and the inflation rate.  However, inflation is not solely caused by fiscal policy; supply-side shocks, past inflation, and inflationary expectations can also contribute.\n"

        "question": "What is the impact of tariffs on international trade?",
        "answer": "Tariffs impact international trade in several ways:\n\n* **Increased prices:** Tariffs raise the price of imported goods, making them less competitive with domestically produced goods.\n* **Reduced imports:**  Higher prices discourage consumers from purchasing imports, potentially leading to a decrease in the volume of imported goods.\n* **Increased domestic production:**  The higher price of imports can incentivize domestic production of those goods, as they become more attractive to consumers.\n* **Trade friction:** Tariffs can spark retaliatory measures from other countries, leading to trade wars and reduced overall trade volumes.\n* **Reduced overall trade:** While tariffs aim to protect domestic industries and reduce reliance on imports, they can also diminish the overall volume of international trade as trade partners retaliate.\n* **Potential for revenue generation:** Tariffs can generate revenue for the government imposing them.\n* **Potential for misallocation of resources:** If tariffs lead to the production of less efficient domestic goods instead of more efficient imports, resources may be misallocated.\n* **Impact on consumers:** Consumers often face higher prices due to tariffs, reducing their purchasing power.\n\n\nThe overall effect of tariffs on international trade is complex and can have both positive (for domestic producers) and negative (for consumers and international trade) consequences.\n"

        "question": "How does price elasticity affect consumer demand?",
        "answer": "Price elasticity of demand describes how sensitive consumer demand is to changes in price.  A high price elasticity means a relatively large change in quantity demanded will occur for a small change in price.  Conversely, a low price elasticity means a small change in quantity demanded for a given price change.  In simpler terms, if the price elasticity is high, consumers are very responsive to price changes, and demand will significantly decrease if the price rises.  If the price elasticity is low, consumers are less responsive to price changes, and demand will not change as much in response to a price change.\n"

        "question": "what is inflation ?",
        "answer": "Inflation is a general increase in the price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time.  Critically, it's not about specific price changes due to supply/demand shifts in individual markets, but rather a decrease in the purchasing power of money.  Different schools of thought, like the Austrian school, define it more specifically as an increase in the money supply that outpaces the demand for money, leading to a fall in the value of money.  Ultimately, inflation reflects a loss of value in a currency.\n"

        "answer": "Behavioral economics studies the mechanisms of human decision-making and how they differ from neoclassical assumptions of rationality.  It models how agents choose strategies when interacting with others with conflicting interests, generalizing maximization approaches (like supply and demand) to include incomplete information.  It has applications beyond economics, including nuclear strategy, ethics, and political science.  The field acknowledges market frictions like lagged responses, search costs, and externalities, making it difficult to isolate behavioral effects.  It also considers situations where individuals perceive control over external events, even when they don't, and has practical applications in areas like consumer decision-making models for AI and public policy.\n"

        "question": "what is austrian school of economics?",
        "answer": "The Austrian School of economics is a school of thought that originated in Vienna in 1871 with Carl Menger and others.  It emphasizes deriving economic theory exclusively from basic principles of human action.  Key contributions include the subjective theory of value, marginalism in price theory, and the economic calculation problem.  Methodologically, it opposed the Historical school, leading to the Methodenstreit.  While current Austrians are globally dispersed, their work remains categorized as \"Austrian economics\".  The school experienced renewed interest in the 1970s following Hayek's Nobel Prize, and within the school, differing views on neoclassical methodology and government intervention exist.\n"

        "question": "explain economics in day to day life.",
        "answer": "Economics in everyday life is about making choices with limited resources.  This applies to everything from deciding what to buy at the grocery store (limited budget, choosing between different products) to how a company decides what to produce (limited resources, maximizing profit).  \n\nNeoclassical economics, a dominant school of thought, emphasizes the interaction of supply and demand to understand these choices.  For example, the price of a product is determined by how much people want it (demand) and how much is available (supply).  \n\nOur daily decisions reflect the scarcity of resources and the idea of maximizing utility (getting the most value from what we have).  This can be seen in choosing between different jobs, investing money, and even deciding how to spend free time.  Understanding economic principles helps us make informed decisions and understand the forces at play in our world.\n"

Its applications are wide-ranging, including auctions, bargaining, mergers and acquisitions pricing, fair division, duopolies, oligopolies, social network formation, agent-based computational economics, general equilibrium, mechanism design, and voting systems.  It's used across various subfields like experimental economics, behavioral economics, information economics, industrial organization, and political economy.  A key use in economics is analyzing strategic interactions between firms, such as competition, cooperation, and pricing strategies.  Economists also apply it to understand good or proper behavior.\n"

        "question": "what is inflation?",
        "answer": "Inflation is a general increase in the prices of goods and services in an economy.  Crucially, it's not about individual price changes due to supply and demand, but a decrease in the purchasing power of a currency, due to an increase in the money supply that isn't matched by a corresponding increase in the need for money. This ultimately leads to a fall in the value of money.  The Austrian School specifically emphasizes that this increase in the money supply is not uniform across all assets, goods, and services, and that this can differentially affect different parts of the economy.\n"
