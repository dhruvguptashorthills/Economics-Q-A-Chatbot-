What is prospect theory?,A theory that explains how people make decisions under conditions of risk and uncertainty.,"Prospect theory is a behavioral economic model developed by Kahneman and Tversky that explains how people make decisions under risk.  It posits that people's decisions are influenced by factors beyond purely rational calculation, such as emotions like fear of loss or greed.  Prospect theory proposes that risky situations are simplified (editing stage) and then evaluated (evaluation stage) using psychological principles;  gains and losses are treated differently, certain outcomes are overweighed, and the problem's structure influences choices.  A revised version, called cumulative prospect theory, focuses solely on the evaluation phase and allows for non-linear probability weighting.  It incorporates psychological traits like overconfidence and limited attention.  Crucially, critics argue that prospect theory, while a useful model of decision-making in specific situations, doesn't necessarily translate to general economic behavior outside of laboratory settings.

What is the role of 'utility-seeking' in economic theory?,It's the assumption that individuals act rationally to maximize their own well-being.,"In economic theory, ""utility-seeking"" is a fundamental concept.  It posits that individuals make choices aimed at maximizing their utility, which is often interpreted as satisfaction or well-being derived from consuming goods and services.  However, the *nature* of utility itself is complex and debated.  Different theories, like neoclassical economics, propose utility functions based on simple maximization of expected utility, while behavioral economics critiques this, suggesting factors like satisficing, prospect theory, and the coherence of wants/beliefs affect utility-seeking behavior.  Furthermore, evolutionary psychology suggests that utility may be tied to maximizing evolutionary fitness, not necessarily current satisfaction.  The challenges in determining what should be included in a utility function highlight the ongoing debate on the precise role and nature of utility-seeking in understanding economic behavior.

What is the moral hazard problem?,"The extent to which an employee's behavior (effort, care, etc.) is hidden from the employer.","The moral hazard problem occurs when one party (the agent) changes their behavior after a contract or agreement is made, potentially to the detriment of the other party (the principal).  This change in behavior often arises because the agent is not fully responsible for the consequences of their actions, as the agreement or insurance may insulate them from those consequences.  Examples include insured individuals driving more recklessly or banks taking on riskier loans knowing they will be bailed out by the government.  Essentially, the promise of protection or compensation reduces incentives for responsible behavior.

Why are performance-based contracts sometimes second-best?,They can preclude full insurance for risk-averse agents.,"Performance-based contracts, while often seen as a good incentive mechanism, can be a second-best solution in certain situations due to limitations in achieving all optimal conditions.  The provided text highlights this by referencing the ""theory of the second best.""  This theory states that if some optimal conditions cannot be met,  improving other aspects of a system might not necessarily lead to overall improvement, or even could worsen the outcome.  This is because the optimal conditions are interconnected and interdependent.  The example given of antitrust law relaxation illustrates how seemingly beneficial actions (like consolidating R&D costs) might not lead to increased allocative efficiency if other crucial factors remain unaddressed.  In essence, the complexity of real-world situations may mean that implementing an *ideal* incentive system is impossible, and a ""second-best"" approach might be the best that can be achieved.

What is adverse selection?,A situation where the principal is not informed about a certain characteristic (type) of the agent when the contract is written.,"Adverse selection occurs when one party in a transaction has more information than the other, leading to a skewed outcome.  Specifically, in a market, the party with more information (usually the buyer or seller) is more likely to be a high-risk individual or party because they can effectively hide their risk factors from the other party. This can result in the market collapsing, or in a situation where the less-informed party, like the insurance company, is essentially paying more for average risk coverage, because high-risk individuals are disproportionately drawn to the market.  It's a result of information asymmetry.
",0.3518967032432556
What are examples of adverse selection?,Health insurance and public procurement contracting.,"Examples of adverse selection include:

* **Insurance market:** High-risk individuals are more likely to buy insurance due to a lack of information about individual risk, legal constraints, or inability to discriminate.
* **Credence goods:**  Goods where the buyer lacks knowledge about quality even after consumption, such as complex medical treatments (e.g., heart surgery).
* **Labor market:**  Firms unsure about worker ability pay average wages, undercompensating high-ability workers, potentially driving them away and attracting low-ability workers.
* **Used car market (Lemons Market):**  Buyers cannot easily distinguish between good and bad used cars (lemons), leading to a market where only low-quality cars are sold.

What is the role of technological advancements in demographic economics research?,"Technological advancements provide new tools for data collection, analysis, and visualization, enabling more sophisticated research.","Technological advancements have played a crucial role in demographic economics by:

1. **Offsetting population growth:** Early on, technological progress was largely offset by population growth, keeping living standards near subsistence.
2. **Increasing the pace of technological progress:** The interaction between technological progress and population size/composition has spurred faster technological advancements.
3. **Enhancing the importance of education:** This accelerating technological change made education more vital for individuals to adapt.
4. **Driving fertility decline:**  Increased investment in education led to a decline in fertility rates.  This freed up resources to be invested in income growth rather than population growth.
5. **Enabling sustained economic growth:**  The shift in resource allocation from population growth to income growth paved the way for sustained economic growth.
6. **Lowering real prices of goods:**  Over the 20th century, technological innovation led to a significant drop in the real price of many goods.

In essence, technological progress has been a key driver of the shift from a Malthusian trap, where population growth limited per-capita income, to sustained economic growth in many countries.

How can demographic economics contribute to understanding fertility decline?,"It examines the economic factors influencing fertility decisions, such as education, income, and access to contraception.","Demographic economics can contribute to understanding fertility decline by examining the interplay between technological progress, population size and composition, and resource allocation.  Specifically, it considers how:

* **Technological progress:**  affects living standards and incentivizes investment in education.
* **Population growth:**  can offset technological gains, or be influenced by access to contraception and changing social norms around family size.
* **Resource allocation to education:**  leads to a decline in fertility as individuals prioritize career advancement over large families.
* **Mortality decline:**  influences parental decisions about family size and investment in children's education, driving an economic-demographic transition.


In summary, demographic economics highlights how various factors, including technology, education, and health, interact to shape population dynamics and influence fertility rates.

What are some economic consequences of increasing life expectancy?,"Consequences include increased demand for healthcare services, changes in retirement patterns, and implications for pension systems.","Increased life expectancy leads to:

* **Greater investments in individual human capital:**  Longer lifespans incentivize investments in education and skills development.
* **Increased economic growth:** This is a result of the above, as a healthier and more educated workforce is more productive.
* **Fewer children:**  Longer lifespans can lead to families having fewer children, as parents may invest more in the quality of education rather than quantity of children.
* **Decreased depreciation rate of health:**  Public health initiatives and medical care aim to improve health outcomes, and with rising life expectancy, this indicates a slower decline in health as people age.
* **Potential for exponential economic growth:**  Small, consistent increases in economic growth over long periods can lead to large differences in standards of living, due to compounding effects (the power of exponential growth).

How does demographic economics address issues of intergenerational equity?,It examines the distribution of resources and opportunities across different generations.,"Demographic economics, as described in the provided text, argues that intergenerational housing inequalities are primarily driven by class-based wealth disparities rather than direct hoarding by older generations.  The focus is on intragenerational wealth inequality within generations like the baby boomers, suggesting a stronger case for inequality stemming from wealth accumulation and labor exploitation by the capital class than a generational conflict.  While some media portray a generational conflict, studies show that younger generations, while recognizing the advantages of older generations, resent government policies, not the older generation itself.  Furthermore, the tendency to view housing as a public policy issue is consistent across generations, implying a potential for intergenerational solidarity.  The text also highlights that governments often consider housing as a safety net for retirement, a perspective that contrasts with a purely market-driven approach.

Explain Okun's law and how it relates to econometrics.,"Okun's law relates GDP growth to the unemployment rate. It can be represented by a linear regression model where the change in unemployment rate is a function of GDP growth, an intercept, a slope coefficient, and an error term. Econometrics helps estimate these parameters and test the statistical significance of the relationship.","Okun's Law describes the empirical relationship between economic growth and unemployment.  Essentially, it suggests that increases in GDP growth are generally associated with decreases in unemployment.  The original version posits a 3% increase in output leads to a 1% decrease in unemployment.

Econometrics enters the picture by providing a way to quantify and test this relationship.  Econometric models, like the linear regression example given, allow economists to estimate the strength of the relationship between GDP growth and unemployment.  These models incorporate a variable (e.g., the change in unemployment rate) that's dependent on another variable (GDP growth) plus other unknown factors.  The econometric goal is to estimate the coefficients (like β₀ and β₁) of these variables.  This gives us a mathematical equation that represents the relationship and allows economists to make predictions about how changes in GDP growth will affect unemployment.  The model also includes an error term (ε) to account for factors besides GDP growth that impact unemployment.  Crucially, the econometric method lets researchers quantify the impact of GDP growth on unemployment while accounting for other influences, making it a powerful tool for economic analysis.

What is the screening theory of education?,The idea that completing education acts as a signal of ability to potential employers.,"The screening theory of education, pioneered by Joseph E. Stiglitz, is based on the economic theory of signaling.  It suggests that education acts as a signal of underlying abilities or skills.  A student who has the ability to succeed in education will be more likely to do so, regardless of the quality of the education itself.  This is in contrast to a simple causal relationship where education *causes* economic growth.  The theory posits that individuals choose to pursue education because it's easier for them to demonstrate their already existing capacity for learning.

What is the difference between 'marginal benefit' and 'effective demand' in healthcare?,"'Marginal benefit' reflects the true demand for medical care, while 'effective demand' considers the impact of insurance and subsidized prices.","The marginal benefit of medical care is related to the underlying ""real demand"" for healthcare, stemming from the desire for good health and influenced by the production function for health.  It represents the benefit derived from each additional unit of care.  Effective demand, on the other hand, takes into account the subsidized prices due to insurance.  Consumers effectively face a different price than the market price, leading to a separate relationship between price and quantity demanded, distinct from the marginal benefit curve.  In essence, effective demand reflects the quantity of medical care demanded *given* the out-of-pocket price, while marginal benefit reflects the underlying value of that care.

What is the difference between GDP and GNI?,"GDP measures production within a country's borders, while GNI (Gross National Income) measures production by a country's citizens, regardless of location.","GDP (Gross Domestic Product) defines its scope according to location.  It measures the total value of goods and services produced *within* a country's borders, regardless of who owns the producing enterprises.  GNI (Gross National Income), on the other hand, defines its scope according to ownership. It measures the total income earned by a country's citizens, regardless of where the production takes place.  This means GNI includes income from citizens' productive assets abroad but excludes income from foreign-owned assets within the country's borders.

In short:

* **GDP:** Production within a country's borders.
* **GNI:** Income earned by a country's citizens, regardless of location of production.

How does GDP relate to income inequality?,GDP doesn't reflect the distribution of income and can mask significant disparities between rich and poor.,"GDP per capita, while a measure of overall economic output, does not account for income distribution.  A high GDP per capita can mask significant income inequality, meaning the average income might be high, but the majority of the population may not share in that wealth.  Studies show a negative correlation between income inequality and economic growth.  In other words, higher inequality tends to be associated with slower or less sustainable economic growth.

It occurs when individuals or organizations prioritize their immediate self-interest over the long-term sustainability of the shared resource, leading to overconsumption and ultimately harming all users.  This happens because the resource is both rivalrous (one person's use diminishes the resource's availability to others) and non-excludable (it's difficult or impossible to prevent people from using it).  Examples include overfishing, overgrazing, and overcrowding of recreational areas.

This simplifies analysis compared to general equilibrium models, which consider the entire economy.  Key assumptions include that prices of substitutes/complements and consumer income remain unchanged, and that the activity in the specific market being analyzed does not affect other markets.

The supply of money is often controlled by the central bank, while the demand for money depends on factors like transactions needs, speculation, and investment opportunities.  Equilibrium occurs where the quantity of money supplied equals the quantity of money demanded at a particular interest rate.

What are revealed preferences?,"Revealed preferences are inferred from observed choices, such as willingness to pay, rather than directly measured.","Revealed preferences, as described by Paul Samuelson, are preferences that are indirectly inferred from observed market choices.  Essentially, people's willingness to pay for goods and services reveals their preferences and the relative value they place on them.  It's a method of measuring utility indirectly through observable actions, like purchasing decisions, rather than attempting a direct measurement of desires or feelings.

What is the difference between cardinal and ordinal utility?,"Cardinal utility assigns numerical values to utility, allowing for comparisons of utility differences. Ordinal utility only ranks preferences without quantifying the differences.","Cardinal utility allows for the measurement and ranking of utility in a way that reflects the *magnitude* of the difference between choices.  For example, a cup of orange juice having 120 ""utils"" conveys not only that it's preferred to a cup of water with 40 ""utils,"" but also that the difference in satisfaction is greater than the difference between the tea (80 ""utils"") and the water.

Ordinal utility, on the other hand, only ranks preferences.  It tells us which bundle is preferred, but not *how much* more preferred it is.  Knowing that two ice creams are preferred to one ice cream is an ordinal statement.  We don't know if the extra utility from the second",0.8391181826591492
What is marginal utility?,Marginal utility is the rate of change of utility from changing the quantity of one good consumed.,"Marginal utility is the rate of change of utility from changing the quantity of one good consumed.

What is an indirect utility function?,An indirect utility function gives the maximum attainable utility given prices and income/wealth.,"An indirect utility function is a nonlinear function that is bounded and asymmetric about the origin.  It represents the utility derived from money.  It is concave in the positive region, reflecting diminishing marginal utility.  Boundedness signifies that beyond a certain amount, money's usefulness diminishes due to the limitations of any given economy.  Asymmetry indicates that gains and losses of money have different impacts on individuals and businesses.

How does a budget constraint affect consumer choice?,"A budget constraint limits the combinations of goods a consumer can afford, influencing demand based on price changes and income/substitution effects.","A budget constraint limits the bundles of goods a consumer can afford.  Consumers are constrained to choose consumption bundles that lie on or below the budget line, as these are the only combinations whose total cost is less than or equal to their budget.  A change in price of a good or the budget itself will shift the budget line, thereby affecting the quantity demanded of goods and the overall consumption choices.  The budget constraint, in conjunction with a consumer's preferences, determines the optimal consumption bundle that maximizes utility within the affordable range.

What are some challenges in defining a utility function?,"Defining a utility function involves subjective factors such as coherence of wants, beliefs, and sense of duty, making it complex to determine what arguments should be included.","The provided text highlights several challenges in defining a utility function, particularly concerning cardinal utility:

* **Inability to objectively measure utility:**  The text argues that changes in behavior due to price or budget constraints cannot be definitively separated from changes in preference. This makes it difficult to isolate and quantify the utility gained from consumption.  The concept of ""utils"" lacks empirical grounding.

* **The ceteris paribus problem:**  The reliance on ""all else equal"" conditions in economic models makes them untestable.  It's impossible to control for every factor influencing consumer behavior, and thus impossible to definitively prove or disprove the model's predictive power.
