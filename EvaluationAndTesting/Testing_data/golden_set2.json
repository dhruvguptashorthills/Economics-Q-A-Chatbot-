    },
    {
        "question": "Didn't they like, hate Keynesianism?",
        "answer": "Yeah, Chicago macroeconomists initially dissed Keynesianism for monetarism, but then switched to new classical macroeconomics with rational expectations.  Nowadays, the lines are kinda blurry, with new Keynesian economics incorporating rational expectations."

        "question": "Is 'Chicago school' like, a real school?",
        "answer": "Nah, the term started in the 1950s for economists at the University of Chicago's Economics Department and related areas like Booth and the Law School. In macroeconomics, it's linked to the 'freshwater' school, unlike the 'saltwater' schools on the coasts."
    },
    {
        "question": "Weren't they like, weirdos in the 50s?",
        "answer": "Totally, since Keynesian economics was super popular then, the Chicago school was seen as heterodox – going against the grain."

    },
    {
        "question": "Nash equilibrium is like competitive equilibrium but without price what?",
        "answer": "The Nash equilibrium is used when the 'price taking' assumption of competitive equilibrium is not appropriate, often due to strategic behavior."
    },
    {
        "question": "Do economists thinks equilibrium price means everything good?",
        "answer": "No, economists caution against assigning a normative meaning (value judgment) to the equilibrium price.  It doesn't guarantee desirable social outcomes."
    },
    {
        "question": "Did Adam Smith like central planning better than free markets?",
        "answer": "No, Adam Smith believed free markets tended towards equilibrium through the price mechanism, unlike central planning."
    },
    {
        "question": "If there's underemployment, is the labor market in equilibrium?",
        "answer": "Keynesian economics suggests underemployment can exist as an equilibrium, where a labor surplus coexists with insufficient demand."

        "question": "Explain von Thunen's monocentric city model and it's important in urban economics?",
        "answer": "Von Thünen didn't create a monocentric city model; that was Alonso, Muth, and Mills. The monocentric model is important because it provides a basic framework for understanding how land use and transportation costs influence urban development, even though real cities are more complex."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is urban economics only focused on Marxist economics and how does this relate to the Economist magazine?",
        "answer": "Urban economics draws from various schools of thought, not just Marxism. While influenced by historical perspectives, modern urban economics is primarily neoclassical. The Economist, reflecting mainstream views, often uses this neoclassical lens in its urban analyses."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is polycentricity and how does Edge Cities relate to cheaper transportation?",
        "answer": "Polycentricity refers to cities with multiple centers of activity, unlike the single-center monocentric model. Joel Garreau's 'Edge City' concept describes these sub-centers. Cheaper transportation contributes to polycentricity by allowing businesses and people to move away from the traditional central business district."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does urban economics differentiate from regional economics and what are some of it's main themes?",
        "answer": "While both deal with spatial economics, urban economics focuses on issues within a single city, while regional economics covers broader geographic areas.  O'Sullivan outlines six main themes in urban economics: market forces in city development, land use, urban transportation, urban problems and public policy, housing and public policy, and local government finance."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why firms locates in isolated regions and how this affect market structure?",
        "answer": "Firms might locate in isolated regions for various reasons, such as access to specific resources or lower operating costs.  Market structure isn't directly affected by isolation but the firm's market performance can be, facing less competition or higher transportation costs, for example."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is spatial organization in urban economics and how does this relates to zoning?",
        "answer": "Spatial organization refers to how different activities – residential, commercial, industrial – are arranged within a city. Zoning is a land-use control that directly influences spatial organization by regulating what can be built in specific areas."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is economics policy implemented only at urban level and how this relates to urban problems?",
        "answer": "Economic policy isn't only implemented at the urban level; it happens at national and regional levels too.  However, many economic policies have direct urban impacts.  Urban economics examines how policies can address urban problems like poverty and crime."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is housing a unique commodity and how does funding and uncertainty affect housing policies?",
        "answer": "Housing is unique because it’s immobile; choosing a house means choosing a location.  Funding limitations and uncertainty about future economic conditions can make it difficult to implement effective housing policies."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are local government expenditures funded and what is the role of perfect market structure in housing analysis?",
        "answer": "Local governments are funded through various sources, such as property taxes, sales taxes, and intergovernmental transfers. The concept of a perfect market structure is a theoretical benchmark used in economic analysis, including housing, but real-world housing markets often deviate from this ideal."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the relationship between urban transportation and light-rail and how does this affect land use patterns?",
        "answer": "Urban transportation, including options like light-rail, significantly influences land use patterns. Efficient transportation allows people to live further from work, leading to urban sprawl. Light-rail investments can stimulate development along their routes, changing how land is used."
    },
    {
        "question": "Did Keynes advocate for unregulated free markets, believing supply would always meet demand?",
        "answer": "No, Keynes argued against the classical view that markets would self-regulate to full employment.  He believed government intervention was necessary, particularly during economic downturns."
    },
    {
        "question": "Was Keynesian economics immediately and universally embraced by economists and politicians?",
        "answer": "No, Keynesian economics faced significant opposition, particularly from classical economists and some political figures like Winston Churchill, who initially opposed government spending to alleviate unemployment."
    },
    {
        "question": "Did Keynes believe pyramid-building was a superior form of economic stimulus compared to infrastructure projects like railways?",
        "answer": "While Keynes used pyramid-building satirically to illustrate unproductive spending, he did advocate for public works projects as a means of stimulating demand during economic downturns, though not necessarily pyramids."
    },
    {
        "question": "Did Keynesian economics prioritize free trade above all else, even during economic crises?",
        "answer": "No, while initially a proponent of free trade, Keynes later advocated for regulated trade and even protectionist measures, especially during the Great Depression, to address trade imbalances."
    },
    {
        "question": "Was Keynesian economics solely responsible for the post-war economic boom?",
        "answer": "While Keynesian policies played a role in post-war prosperity, other factors like the need to rebuild after the war and the removal of wartime uncertainty also contributed significantly."

    {
        "question": "Did Adam Smith believe that appealing to the 'brother-love' of merchants was the best way to secure goods and services?",
        "answer": "No, Smith argued that appealing to self-interest and paying for labor was the most effective approach."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does a free market necessitate competition?",
        "answer": "While a free market doesn't directly require competition, it needs a framework that allows new entrants, fostering competition as a consequence."
    },
    {
        "question": "Do all economists agree that government intervention is always harmful to a free market?",
        "answer": "No, some economists argue that regulation can sometimes improve market function and address market failures."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is laissez-faire capitalism universally accepted as the most effective economic system?",
        "answer": "No, critics argue that laissez-faire systems can lead to monopolies and other issues requiring government intervention."

    {
        "question": "Did Benjamin Strong and Montagu Norman agree on a definition of central banks that included the power to manipulate public opinion through 'fake news'?",
        "answer": "The text mentions that Norman and Strong agreed on a definition of central banks, but it says nothing about manipulating public opinion or 'fake news'. This is a misrepresentation of the information provided."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the text argue that central banks should prioritize environmental goals over economic stability?",
        "answer": "The text discusses the emerging debate about central banks incorporating environmental goals, but it doesn't advocate prioritizing them over economic stability.  There are both proponents and critics of this idea mentioned."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the 'shat' the precursor to modern cryptocurrency due to its detachment from physical commodities?",
        "answer": "While the text mentions the 'shat' as an ancient Egyptian unit of account, it was linked to gold. This contradicts the premise of the question about detachment from physical commodities.  Furthermore, there's no connection made to cryptocurrency."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the text claim that the Federal Reserve's primary goal is to maintain global economic dominance through manipulating the US dollar?",
        "answer": "The text states that the Federal Reserve plays an outsized role in the international monetary market due to the widespread use of the US dollar. However, it doesn't claim that the Fed's primary goal is global dominance through manipulation.  Its stated primary goal is maintaining price stability."
    },
    {
        "question": "Did the Bank of England's refusal to lend to Overend, Gurney and Company prove the inherent instability of fractional reserve banking and lead to the immediate adoption of a full-reserve system?",
        "answer": "The text mentions the Bank of England's initially criticized response to the failure of Overend, Gurney and Company, which led to it adopting the role of lender of last resort. It doesn't say this proved the instability of fractional reserve banking or led to a full-reserve system.  Fractional reserve banking remains the dominant system."
    },
    {
        "question": "Did the Ming Dynasty embrace paper money due to its success in controlling inflation?",
        "answer": "No. Fearing the inflation that plagued the Yuan dynasty, the Ming dynasty initially rejected the use of paper money and reverted to using copper coins."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does deflation always follow inflation historically?",
        "answer": "Not always. While there have been periods where inflation and deflation alternated, particularly when commodity money was used, this wasn't a strict pattern. Long periods of inflation could occur with large infusions of gold or silver into an economy."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is the consumer price index (CPI) the sole measure of inflation?",
        "answer": "No. While CPI is widely used, there are many other measures of price inflation, including the PCEPI, GDP deflator, and indices for specific sectors like commodities or housing."
    },
    {
        "question": "Do all economists agree that inflation is primarily caused by excessive money supply growth?",
        "answer": "No. While surveys show a majority of American economists agree with this statement, it's not a unanimous view. Other schools of thought, like the Austrian School, offer different perspectives on the causes of inflation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Are wage and price controls a universally effective solution for combating inflation?",
        "answer": "No. While they've been used successfully in wartime, their effectiveness in other contexts is mixed. Economists generally advise against their use except in temporary and exceptional circumstances, coupled with policies addressing the underlying causes of inflation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is global government debt entirely due to the COVID-19 recession?",
        "answer": "No. While the COVID-19 recession significantly increased government debt, the rise started after 2007 due to stimulus measures during the Great Recession."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does government debt always lead to hyperinflation?",
        "answer": "No. While excessive money creation to pay off debt can lead to hyperinflation, as seen in Weimar Germany, this is an extreme case.  Government debt itself does not automatically cause hyperinflation."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is a government's debt identical to a household's debt?",
        "answer": "No. Economists generally reject this comparison. Governments have different functions and constraints than households, including the ability to print money, tax, and influence economic cycles through spending."
    },
    {
        "question": "Are all government debts considered risk-free?",
        "answer": "No.  While debt issued in a country's own fiat currency can be considered low-risk for domestic purchasers, foreign investors bear exchange rate risks.  Also, sub-national governments and countries using a shared currency like the Euro face different risk profiles."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does all government debt appear on balance sheets?",
        "answer": "No.  Contingent liabilities, like loan guarantees and future social security payments, are often not included in the reported debt figures, even though they represent significant potential future obligations."

    {
        "question": "Did the Soviet Union achieve a fully centrally-planned communist economy?",
        "answer": "While the Soviet Union aimed for a fully centrally-planned economy, it maintained wages and markets, indicating it had not reached a pure communist stage."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does commons-based peer production, exemplified by Wikipedia, operate for profit?",

    },
    {
        "question": "Did Adam Smith advocate for the complete removal of psychology from economics in the 18th century?",
        "answer": "No. Adam Smith incorporated psychological reasoning in his work, including concepts like loss aversion, which are now central to behavioral economics. The rejection of psychology in economics happened much later, in the early 1900s."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does behavioral economics suggest that placing fruit at eye level is a manipulative tactic equivalent to banning junk food?",
        "answer": "No.  Behavioral economics suggests nudges like placing fruit at eye level can influence choices without restricting options.  This is different from a ban, which removes the choice entirely.  The concept of a nudge is about influencing, not coercing."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is bounded rationality a concept championed by traditional economists to defend the perfect rationality of humans?",
        "answer": "No. Bounded rationality, introduced by Herbert Simon, acknowledges the limitations of human cognition in decision-making. It challenges the traditional economic assumption of perfect rationality."
    },
    {
        "question": "Did Daniel Kahneman win the Nobel Prize for proving that humans are always irrational?",
        "answer": "No. Kahneman's Nobel Prize recognized his work integrating psychological insights into economics, particularly concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty.  While his work highlighted deviations from perfect rationality, it doesn't claim humans are *always* irrational."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does behavioral economics argue that heuristics always lead to optimal decisions?",
        "answer": "No. Heuristics are mental shortcuts that can simplify decision-making but can also lead to suboptimal or biased choices. Behavioral economics studies these biases to understand how they influence decisions."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the consumer confidence index measure global consumer optimism?",

        "question": "If the CCI drops by 2%, is this considered a significant economic indicator?",
        "answer": "Yes, any change in the CCI, even less than 5%, indicates a shift in the economic direction."
    },
    {
        "question": "Did Paul Douglas believe the Chicago School's focus on market decisions being always right and profit as the supreme value was sufficient for the 18th century?",
        "answer": "No. Paul Douglas believed that this focus, which he observed among his colleagues at the University of Chicago, was insufficient even for the 18th century, let alone for his own time."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does the Chicago School of Economics advocate for strong government intervention in the economy, similar to Keynesianism?",
        "answer": "No.  Chicago macroeconomic theory rejected Keynesianism, favoring monetarism and later new classical macroeconomics.  Milton Friedman, a key figure in the school, advocated for laissez-faire government policy."
    },
    {
        "question": "Was Frank Knight, a member of the 'Old Chicago' school, a strong advocate for general equilibrium theory?",

    {
        "question": "Did the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH), championed by Eugene Fama, predict the 2007-2008 financial crisis?",
        "answer": "No. Proponents of the EMH argue that the market crash was unpredictable and therefore consistent with the hypothesis.  They contend that a lack of crashes would actually contradict the EMH."

    },
    {
        "question": "According to the text, does faster transportation cause urban areas to become more monocentric?",
        "answer": "The text argues the opposite. Faster and cheaper transportation allows people to live further from the CBD, contributing to polycentricity, not monocentricity."
