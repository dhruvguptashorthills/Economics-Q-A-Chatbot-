  },
  {
    "question": "Does the text claim that the Federal Reserve's primary goal is to maintain global economic dominance through manipulating the US dollar?",
    "answer": "The text states that the Federal Reserve plays an outsized role in the international monetary market due to the widespread use of the US dollar.

While his work highlighted deviations from perfect rationality, it doesn't claim humans are *always* irrational."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does behavioral economics argue that heuristics always lead to optimal decisions?",
    "answer": "No. Heuristics are mental shortcuts that can simplify decision-making but can also lead to suboptimal or biased choices. Behavioral economics studies these biases to understand how they influence decisions."

  },
  {
    "question": "Does the Chicago School of Economics advocate for strong government intervention in the economy, similar to Keynesianism?",
    "answer": "No.  Chicago macroeconomic theory rejected Keynesianism, favoring monetarism and later new classical macroeconomics.  Milton Friedman, a key figure in the school, advocated for laissez-faire government policy."
  },
  {
    "question": "Was Frank Knight, a member of the 'Old Chicago' school, a strong advocate for general equilibrium theory?",
    "answer": "No. Knight, along with Simons and Director, focused on incentives and the complexity of economic events rather than general equilibrium theory."
  },
  {
    "question": "Did Ronald Coase argue that laws and regulations are crucial for helping people achieve efficient resource allocation?",
    "answer": "No. Coase argued that in a world without transaction costs, bargaining would lead to efficient resource allocation regardless of legal rulings. He believed laws and regulations are less important than lawyers and planners think."
  },
  {
    "question": "Did the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH), championed by Eugene Fama, predict the 2007-2008 financial crisis?",
    "answer": "No. Proponents of the EMH argue that the market crash was unpredictable and therefore consistent with the hypothesis.  They contend that a lack of crashes would actually contradict the EMH."

    "question": "What is the comparative static effect of consumer income on price?",
    "answer": "Negative, meaning that a rise in consumer income leads to a lower price."
  }
,
  {
    "question": "Does Marxist economics advocate for monocentric city models due to its emphasis on centralized planning?",
    "answer": "The text mentions Marxist economics as a historical influence but doesn't link it to monocentric city models. Monocentric models are primarily associated with neoclassical economics."
  },
  {
    "question": "Did Joel Garreau develop the monocentric city model which is widely used in urban economics?",
    "answer": "No, Joel Garreau described the concept of 'Edge City', which challenges the monocentric model. The monocentric model was pioneered by Alonso, Muth, and Mills."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does urban economics primarily focus on macroeconomic trends to understand urban development?",
    "answer": "No, urban economics is a branch of microeconomics, focusing on individual households, firms, and their spatial relationships within urban areas."
  },
  {
    "question": "According to the text, does faster transportation cause urban areas to become more monocentric?",
    "answer": "The text argues the opposite. Faster and cheaper transportation allows people to live further from the CBD, contributing to polycentricity, not monocentricity."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does urban economics ignore the allocation of resources, focusing solely on spatial relationships?",
    "answer": "No, urban economics studies the allocation of resources *across space*. It combines the economic principle of resource allocation with a focus on spatial relationships."
