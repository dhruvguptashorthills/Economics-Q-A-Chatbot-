        "question": "In monopoly, is MR equal to MC or demand?",
        "answer": "In a monopoly, marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC) at the profit-maximizing quantity."
    },
    {
        "question": "Nash equilibrium is like competitive equilibrium but without price what?",
        "answer": "The Nash equilibrium is used when the 'price taking' assumption of competitive equilibrium is not appropriate, often due to strategic behavior."
    },
    {
        "question": "Do economists thinks equilibrium price means everything good?",
        "answer": "No, economists caution against assigning a normative meaning (value judgment) to the equilibrium price.  It doesn't guarantee desirable social outcomes."

    {
        "question": "Did Adam Smith like central planning better than free markets?",
        "answer": "No, Adam Smith believed free markets tended towards equilibrium through the price mechanism, unlike central planning."
    },
    {
        "question": "If there's underemployment, is the labor market in equilibrium?",
        "answer": "Keynesian economics suggests underemployment can exist as an equilibrium, where a labor surplus coexists with insufficient demand."
    },

        "question": "Comparative statics compares two what equilibria?",
        "answer": "Comparative statics compares two static equilibria to understand the impact of changes in market conditions."

        "question": "Explain von Thunen's monocentric city model and it's important in urban economics?",
        "answer": "Von Thünen didn't create a monocentric city model; that was Alonso, Muth, and Mills. The monocentric model is important because it provides a basic framework for understanding how land use and transportation costs influence urban development, even though real cities are more complex."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is urban economics only focused on Marxist economics and how does this relate to the Economist magazine?",
        "answer": "Urban economics draws from various schools of thought, not just Marxism. While influenced by historical perspectives, modern urban economics is primarily neoclassical. The Economist, reflecting mainstream views, often uses this neoclassical lens in its urban analyses."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is polycentricity and how does Edge Cities relate to cheaper transportation?",
        "answer": "Polycentricity refers to cities with multiple centers of activity, unlike the single-center monocentric model. Joel Garreau's 'Edge City' concept describes these sub-centers. Cheaper transportation contributes to polycentricity by allowing businesses and people to move away from the traditional central business district."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does urban economics differentiate from regional economics and what are some of it's main themes?",
        "answer": "While both deal with spatial economics, urban economics focuses on issues within a single city, while regional economics covers broader geographic areas.  O'Sullivan outlines six main themes in urban economics: market forces in city development, land use, urban transportation, urban problems and public policy, housing and public policy, and local government finance."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why firms locates in isolated regions and how this affect market structure?",
        "answer": "Firms might locate in isolated regions for various reasons, such as access to specific resources or lower operating costs.  Market structure isn't directly affected by isolation but the firm's market performance can be, facing less competition or higher transportation costs, for example."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is spatial organization in urban economics and how does this relates to zoning?",
        "answer": "Spatial organization refers to how different activities – residential, commercial, industrial – are arranged within a city. Zoning is a land-use control that directly influences spatial organization by regulating what can be built in specific areas."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is economics policy implemented only at urban level and how this relates to urban problems?",
        "answer": "Economic policy isn't only implemented at the urban level; it happens at national and regional levels too.  However, many economic policies have direct urban impacts.  Urban economics examines how policies can address urban problems like poverty and crime."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is housing a unique commodity and how does funding and uncertainty affect housing policies?",
        "answer": "Housing is unique because it’s immobile; choosing a house means choosing a location.  Funding limitations and uncertainty about future economic conditions can make it difficult to implement effective housing policies."
    },
    {
        "question": "How are local government expenditures funded and what is the role of perfect market structure in housing analysis?",
        "answer": "Local governments are funded through various sources, such as property taxes, sales taxes, and intergovernmental transfers. The concept of a perfect market structure is a theoretical benchmark used in economic analysis, including housing, but real-world housing markets often deviate from this ideal."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the relationship between urban transportation and light-rail and how does this affect land use patterns?",
        "answer": "Urban transportation, including options like light-rail, significantly influences land use patterns. Efficient transportation allows people to live further from work, leading to urban sprawl. Light-rail investments can stimulate development along their routes, changing how land is used."
